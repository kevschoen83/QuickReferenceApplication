# QuickReferenceApplication

Author/Design/Coder:  Kevin Schoen

This is my Java Quick Reference Application.  The purpose of this application is to assist me in my journey to learn
and become a better software programmer/engineer by providing me with an all-encompasing resource where I can
go to find quick hints/tips/syntax.  The application is a RESTFul app that uses a MySQL database and
HTTP endpoints to manipulate/read the data.

This application started when I began learning about Regular Expressions (regex) to manipulate strings.  It became
clear to me that it would be very useful to have some type of database that I could add to and manipulate so that
I could quickly reference when looking for specific symbols and what they mean.
---
At the moment this application is specific to Regular Expressions, I forsee a future where I can expand this database
to include many different aspects of Java Programming that I need help with a quick reference.
